        <h1 >Gift Blanket To Widow‚Äôs In Vrindavan</h1>
        <p >Winters are not a blessing for everyone, especially those without a roof. In Vrindavan, thousands of sadhus live on the streets, and many Matajis reside in makeshift houses with roofs covered by small tin or plastic sheets. They lack quality blankets to shield themselves from severe cold waves.<br></br>

We are distributing high-quality mink blankets, each weighing 2 kg, to provide warmth and comfort. Your support ensures that they can better endure the harsh cold storms and feel blessed. These blankets make a significant difference in helping them face the challenges of the winter season.</p>
